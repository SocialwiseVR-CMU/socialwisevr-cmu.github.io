The requirements for our project were established through collaboration with our partner organization, SocialWise VR, and iterative feedback from user testing. The primary goal was to develop an onboarding course that enhances the accessibility and usability of the SocialWise VR platform for neurodivergent young adults. Below is a detailed description of the requirements agreed upon and executed in our project:

Agreed Requirements with Partner Organization
=====
1. Course Overview
    - Provide a clear and concise introduction to SocialWise VR, explaining the purpose and structure of the courses.
    - Help users assess whether the course aligns with their goals by outlining expected outcomes and skills to be developed.
2. Introduction to VR Interactions
    - Offer a straightforward and step-by-step guide to VR interactions, including how to navigate, interact with elements, and adjust VR settings.
    - Reduce user anxiety by providing a slower-paced, sample class with captions to accommodate varied processing speeds and improve comprehension.
3. Pause and Exit Functionality
    - Include a reliable and intuitive way for users to pause or exit the course when feeling overwhelmed, ensuring they can resume later without losing progress.
    - Enhance controller functionality to provide consistent and responsive feedback (e.g., visual or haptic cues) for pausing or exiting the course.
4. Accessibility Features
    - Integrate customizable settings for sound, font size, and color contrast, allowing users to tailor the VR experience to their individual needs.
    - Ensure these features are easy to locate and adjust, with specific instructions included in the onboarding module.

Additional Requirements Identified During Project Execution
=====
1. Facilitator Involvement
    - Include guidance for collaborating with facilitators, such as obtaining approval and codes to begin the onboarding process.
    - Provide additional instructions on where to access resources for resolving hardware issues (e.g., referencing the Meta website).
2. Noise Differentiation and Audio Management
    - Address sensory overwhelm by enabling volume adjustments and distinguishing between background and foreground noise.
    - Adjust the audio sequence to prevent overlapping sounds, particularly during instructional content.
3. Gradual Scenario Introduction
    - Begin the onboarding with quieter, less intense scenarios to help neurodivergent users acclimate to the VR environment.
4. Visual Cues for Navigation
    - Add visual aids, such as pulsing effects, to make interactive elements like “continue” buttons more noticeable and intuitive.
5. 2D Preview Option
    - Develop a 2D preview of the onboarding module, offering users and facilitators an accessible way to familiarize themselves with the content before transitioning to the full VR experience.
