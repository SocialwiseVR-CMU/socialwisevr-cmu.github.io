To prioritize the stories, we assessed impact (how much the feature improves user experience) and effort (the development resources required). This matrix helped us identify:

- High Impact, Low Effort Stories:
    - **Adjustable Speech Speed**: Enhances understanding for users with reading/comprehension challenges.
    - **SWVR Course Overview**: Helps users decide if the course aligns with their goals, reducing drop-off.
    - **VR Equipment Guidance**: Ensures smooth navigation and reduces frustration.
    - **Step-by-Step Social Training**: Core features supporting learning without overwhelming users.
- Medium to High Impact, Medium to High Effort Stories:
    - **Customizable Sensory Settings**: Improves comfort but is less critical for learning outcomes.
    - **Automatic Volume Adjustment**: Enhances accessibility for hearing-impaired users.
    - **Accessible Social Feedback**: Key for skill improvement but complex to implement.
    - **Personalized Learning Path**: Boosts engagement by tailoring the experience but requires significant resources.

After discussions with the client regarding initial prioritizations and research into implementation feasibility, we made key adjustments to our user stories. Specifically, we determined that adjusting speech speed is not currently supported by the app and would be out of scope for development. Additionally, the client proposed a new user story focused on managing feelings of overwhelm during the experience. Based on these insights, we finalized the user stories for Milestone 1 and Milestone 2.
