We asked 4 neurodivergent individuals to participate in our study, all of whom identified with having ADHD, autism, depression, or anxiety.

Tasks We Asked the User to Do
=====
1. Share demographic details and VR experience.
1. Experience the BBQ module in SWVR App
1. Answer questions about their experience with SWVR App
1. Interact with the SocialWiseVR onboarding module.
1. Answer follow-up questions on onboarding experience. Describe tasks such as adjusting video volume, navigating accessibility features, and reflecting on the module’s usability.

Positive Aspects of the Evaluation
=======
- The application was clear and straightforward (P2, P3)
- P1 expressed a positive attitude towards the usefulness for learning navigation in VR. 
- It was also a good design choice to include a video clip of the actual Socialwise VR app in the tutorial to prep the users beforehand (P3). 

Overall, we received high scores on our Likert scale questions, as seen below (1 - strongly disagree, 7 - strongly agree):

| Statement    | P1 | P2 | P3 | P4 |
| -------- | ------- |
| The onboarding module was helpful in understanding the purpose of the app         | 7 | 2 | 6 | 6 |
| The onboarding module was helpful in navigating the app                           | 7 | 5 | 5 | 7 |
| The onboarding module was implemented with high-quality                           | 7 | 5 | 7 | 7 |
| The onboarding module met your expectations                                       | 7 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
| I would recommend the onboarding module before using the app to other new clients | 7 | 4 | 7 | 7 |

Negative Aspects of the Evaluation
======
In one section of our onboarding tutorial, we included a demo video of a scene used in the Socialwise VR app. However, P2 pointed out that the video audio overlapped with our embedded voiceover audio, which was fixed for the final prototype.

Additionally, after we conducted the study, we reviewed the participant's answers. While all of them were seemingly straightforward and aligned with our expectations, we dug deeper into what their specific phrasing implies. We noticed that when prompted where to find the accessibility features, P3 correctly said “settings,” but was unable to describe in detail exactly where it was located. This could be an indicator for information overload during the tutorial, and we determined the need to provide an easily referenceable format for users to refer back to. Thus, it solidified our initial intentions of creating both a 2D and 3D version of our tutorial.

As seen above in the Likert table, some participants had neutral or negative ratings regarding the usefulness of the course. We concluded that different users will have potentially different needs, and will not represent all kinds of possible customers. We targeted recruiting towards people with little experience, but some prior knowledge of using a VR headset may have also influenced their responses.

Changes We Woule Have Made to the Design Based on Lessons Learned
=====
1. **Clearer Audio**: For the final prototype, we had enough time to change the voiceover so that it didn't overlap with the demo video clip audio. This was a critical pain point, so we wanted to address it as soon as we received the feedback
1. **Additional Details about the Course**: We also implemented the instructions for describing the role of the facilitator in the Socialwise VR app, as suggested by our client. (See [client feedback](https://socialwisevr-cmu.github.io/client-feedback))
1. **In-app functions**: Given more time and resources, such as access to the client codebase, it would have been interesting to develop these features in-app. However, due to the initial barriers regarding account access and headset development, we did not have enough time to explore such implementations. Yet, our team managed to still highlight such features that already exist with the headset and could already be applied to the VR app directly. Additionally, we managed to implement our application solution in 3D format, a difficult technical challenge that we overcame.
