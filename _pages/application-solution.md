Based on the project goal and initial research, We brainstormed **9 user stories** based on the needs of neurodivergent individuals to improve accessibility and engagement in the SWVR course. These stories focused on features such as personalized learning paths, adjustable sensory settings, and step-by-step guidance to address challenges like sensory overload, unfamiliarity with VR technology, and difficulties in social interactions.

By prioritizing **high-impact, low-effort stories**, we aim to deliver critical features early while planning for more complex features in later iterations.

Continue navigating to explore what we prioritized and what we considered.
