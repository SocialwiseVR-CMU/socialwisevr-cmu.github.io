Tasks We Asked the User to Do
=====
1. Share demographic details and VR experience.
1. Experience the BBQ module in SWVR App
1. Answer questions about their experience with SWVR App
1. Interact with the SocialWiseVR onboarding module.
1. Answer follow-up questions on onboarding experience. Complete tasks such as adjusting video volume, navigating accessibility features, and reflecting on the module’s usability.

Positive Aspects of the Evaluation
=======
- The onboarding module clarified the app’s purpose and its support for neurodivergent users.
- Users found the overall quality of the onboarding module to be high, rating it 6 out of 7.
- Participants appreciated learning how to adjust VR devices and manage feelings of overwhelm by removing the headset.

Negative Aspects of the Evaluation
======
- The fast pace of speech and lack of captions made it difficult for neurodivergent users to follow along, often leaving them feeling overwhelmed.
- - Unfamiliarity with the VR controller caused confusion, as users did not know which buttons to use to pause or navigate the app.
Users struggled to locate and adjust key accessibility features, such as audio volume, text size, and color contrast, highlighting the need for clearer instructions and more intuitive design.
- The 2D version is clear and easy to understand but has limitations in simulating the 3D environment and cannot integrate with the VR course.

Changes We Made to the Design Based on Lessons Learned
=====
1. **Implement VR Equipment Guidance**: In the next iteration, we updated the controller's pause feature to make it more intuitive and responsive, adding visual and haptic feedback to confirm activation, so users can pause or quit confidently.
1. **Implement VR Accessibility Guidance**: We also implemented the instructions for adjusting accessibility features, reducing the learning curve for new users.
1. **2D + 3D Solution**: In the next iteration, we build both 2D and 3D versions of the onboarding course to provide a more flexible and immersive experience for learners.
