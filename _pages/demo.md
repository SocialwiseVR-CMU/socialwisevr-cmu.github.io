We created both a 2D version and a 3D version of the onboarding module to accommodate different user needs. The 2D version is created in Figma where all content is displayed on a laptop screen and users can interact with all of the content using a mouse. The 2D version makes it convenient to share the module content across different platforms and also simplifies the onboarding process without the risk of overwhelming users before transitioning to a 3D environment. The 3D version helps users familiarize with the 3D environment before entering the main course. It also seamlessly integrates into the SWVR app for a cohesive experience.

To create the 3D VR version of the introductory course, we followed a structured process that integrated design, development, and testing:

1. **Content design**:
We began by outlining the course structure, including key interactions, accessibility features, and visual elements tailored for neurodiverse users. This phase involved creating storyboards and mockups to visualize user flows and interactions.

2. **3D modeling and asset development**:
We developed 3D assets for the VR environment using Unity. The design emphasized high-contrast visuals and clear voice prompts to ensure accessibility.

3. **VR environment development**:
We implemented the VR environment in Unity, leveraging its VR development toolkit to build interactive elements. Accessibility features were integrated during this phase.

4. **User interaction integration**:
To ensure intuitive navigation, we configured controller interactions and added features such as visual feedback for key actions (using buttons to jump to the next page).

5. **Testing and iteration**:
Finally, we conducted user testing with a neurodiverse population to gather feedback on usability and accessibility. Based on this feedback, weâ€™ve refined the VR environment and features to improve the overall user experience.
