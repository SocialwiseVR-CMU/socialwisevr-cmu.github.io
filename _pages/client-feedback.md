Previously, we emphasized the desire to build a 3D application, even though we were encountering technical issues. However, after meeting with Nicole, she expressed interest in the 2D version more. She explained that it might be more straightforward and less overwhelming to have the onboarding course in a 2D environment instead. Additionally, she gave us some feedback on the content of the tutorial. For example, she pointed out specific aspects of the Socialwise VR application that could be explained, such as the use of the facilitator side and code needed to join the course.

Overall, we received positive feedback from the client, and she was excited to show this to the Socialwise team! Additionally, Nicole was appreciative that we were able to bring to her attention the need and use of accessibility features on the headset, as it helps them serve the larger disability community at large.
