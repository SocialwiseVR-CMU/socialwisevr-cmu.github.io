This is a final report for a project done for Carnegie Mellon's 05-899 Celebrating Accessibility class. 

**Project Members**: Amanda Li, Rebecca Jiang, Xiang Chen, Yvette Wang

**Client**: [Socialwise VR](https://www.socialwisevr.com/), Nicole Lockerman

Project Context
======
SocialWise VR provides a VR-based educational platform that focuses on simulating real-world social scenarios to help neurodivergent users practice and improve their social interactions. However, the platform’s pre-existing system lacked an accessible and structured onboarding experience for first-time users.
For neurodivergent individuals, adapting to new technologies like VR can be especially challenging due to potential sensory sensitivities, unfamiliar interfaces, or the cognitive load associated with learning a new system. This challenge was compounded by limited guidance in navigating the platform’s features, as well as the absence of tools for customizing VR settings to meet users' individual needs.
Recognizing these gaps, SocialWise VR approached our team to design an onboarding course that would not only introduce users to the platform's structure and interactions but also integrate customizable accessibility features such as sound adjustments, font size control, and color contrast settings.

Project Goal
======
Our team worked closely with SocialWise VR to establish the following key goals for the project:
1. Create an accessible onboarding experience: Develop a course that introduces first-time users to the platform in an intuitive and user-friendly way.
1. Enhance accessibility customization: Provide tools and guidance for users to personalize their VR experience, addressing sensory or usability needs.
1. Empower user confidence: Design the onboarding process to reduce anxiety and increase familiarity with both VR hardware and SocialWise VR’s course structure.
1. Promote autonomy: Enable neurodivergent users to make informed decisions about how they engage with accessibility features, respecting their preferences and promoting independence.
